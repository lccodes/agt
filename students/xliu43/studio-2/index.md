Developing Countries: 12.4
Developed Countries: 18.35

#### First Quartile Fertility rate (_births per woman_)

#### We sorted the Internet users (per 100 people) by ascending. And we found that India has the fewest internet users, and Germany has the most.

#### We looked up the specific value of China for the GINI Coefficient as well as the Germany and Australia GINI Coefficient, and we found that China has almost doubled GINI Coefficient as developed countries.
China has a GINI Coefficient of 46.9.

#### We created the pivot table to see the female labor percentage in each country. And we found that China with a 44 percentage, has almost the same level as developed countries. India, however, has only 24 percentage.
