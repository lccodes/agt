<p>Note: We lost all of the data that we produced in “conduct your analysis.” We also lost all data that used to appear in columns O through Y. However, we had calculated the mean, median, filtered the data, sorted, created 2 pivot tables, made a bar chart, and made a scatter plot. Below I will explain how we did each component and also try to summarize our results to the best of our ability (memory). We cannot include any tables or graphs since all of the data is missing from our LibreOffice. (Only have an old bar chart we originally made but data inside is incorrect)</p>
<p>AVERAGE: Using the =AVERAGE function we calculated the means for all quantitative data. (missing o through y of all quantitative data)</p>
<p>MEDIAN:Using the =MEDIAN function we calculated the means for all quantitative data. (missing o through y of all quantitative data)</p>
<p>FILTERS: We filtered our data to only look at the data that included Europe as the region. We did this to simplify the data set when analyzing to make it easier to draw broad conclusions (assuming geographic location would cause the data to have more similarities)</p>
<p>SORTING: We sorted the data in ascending order by total population (Column T). From our memory Liechtenstein had the smallest population and the Russian confederation had the largest. This was interesting to see the range in size of the countries.</p>
<p>PIVOT TABLES: We made two pivot tables. The first compared mean years of schooling with total population, only looking at European countries. The pivot table gave us the average of mean years of schooling. We primarily made this to find correlation (for future graphs). The other pivot table compared Life expectancy at birth against expected years of schooling (still only Europe).</p>
<p>BAR CHART: Using the the data from the pivot table with population vs schooling. We put population on the x axis and schooling on the y. Titled it and labeled the axes. We expected skewedness with a tail to the left(low population =low schooling). However, the bar chart showed no symmetry and our assumption was wrong.</p>
<p>SCATTER PLOT: Using the data from the pivot table with life expectancy and expected years of schooling, we created a connected scatter plot. We placed life expectancy on the x axis and expected years of schooling on the y. As we predicted there was a positive linear correlation among this data with limited outliers.</p>
