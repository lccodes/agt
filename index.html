                <p>
This course will introduce students to a variety of statistical and
computational techniques that data scientists use to tell stories.
The subject matter for such stories might range from the American
slave trade to the 2016 presidential election.  As an example of the
former, data scientists have designed powerful visualizations
demonstrating the growth and demise of the slave trade over time,
highlighting the extent of the human displacement.  For the latter,
one could imagine mining Twitter feeds to measure the public's
relative interest in various presidential candidates, thereby
predicting a winner.
                </p>
                <p>
Data fluency can be understood to encapsulate both data literacy and
data communication.  Data literacy includes the basics of statistics
and machine learning.  Data communication relies heavily on principles
of design.  Students will be taught to apply statistical, machine
learning algorithms (clustering, regression, and classification) to
data sets in order to extract meaningful information from them.  They
will also be taught elements of design, and to use visualization tools
such to graphically display potentially complex relationships in a
comprehensible way.

                <h3>Grading</h3>
                <p>
                Grading rubrics in CS1951k are developed by the professor in
                conjunction with undergraduate TAs.  TAs then grade all assignments,
                although the professor assigns final grades and reviews assignments as
                necessary (e.g., in all borderline cases).  Grade complaints on
                individual assignments should be addressed to the relevant TA,
                but final grade complaints can be addressed to the professor.
                The grading breakdown is as follows:
                </p>
                
                <table class="table">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Assignment</th>
                        <th>Percentage</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Attendance</td>
                        <td>?</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Labs</td>
                        <td>?</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Homeworks</td>
                        <td>?</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Projects</td>
                        <td>?</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>


                <h3>Late Policy</h3>
                <p>
                For assignments that are to be turned in electronically, students will
                be granted three free late days, which can be applied, as needed, over
                the course of the semester.  In the unfortunate situation that these
                three free late days are all used up, late day penalties will apply:
                -10% within 24 hours, and -25% within 48.  No assignments will be
                accepted electronically more than 48 hours beyond their due date.
                </p>
                <p>
                For assignments that are to be graded interactively (meaning students
                have a set time at which they will be meeting a TA), the following
                late penalties always apply: if the student is late by 10 minutes or
                less, -10%; 10 to 20 minutes, -20%; more than 20 minutes counts as a
                "no show", for which the penalty is -50%.  This same penalty schedule
                applies recursively to rescheduled interactive gradings following a no
                show.  Last-minute email requests to reschedule interactive gradings
                must be sent to the relevant grader(s) and to the head TAs at least 2
                hours prior to the scheduled meeting time to avoid any penalties.
                </p>
                <p>
                For group projects that are graded interactively, if some members show
                up for the grading session while others do not, the grading will
                proceed, and those who do not appear will receive a grade of 0 for
                that portion of the project, while those who appear late will be
                penalized according to the aforementioned penalty schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                Extensions may be granted by the professor in extreme circumstances.
                If you are ill, please do not ask for an extension without a note from
                health services.
                </p>

                <h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
                <p>
                Students are encouraged to collaborate with their peers in CSCI1951k.
                </p>
                <p>
                When working on homework assignments, students may consult one
                another; but students are required to list the names of all students
                with whom they discussed an assignment on their submitted work.
                Unnatural similarities among students' submissions with other students
                whose names are not listed, or excessive overlap with students whose names
                are listed, will be forwarded to the Dean of the
                College's office for review, to assess whether or not there has been a
                violation of Brown's Academic Code.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you have any questions about this policy, please ask the course
                staff for clarification.  Not understanding our policy is not grounds
                for not abiding by it.
                </p>

                <h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
                <p>
                The computer science department is committed to diversity and
                inclusion, and strives to create a climate conducive to the success of
                women, students of color, students of all (or no) sexual orientations,
                and any other students who feel marginalized for any reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you feel you have been been mistreated by another student, or by
                any of the course staff, please feel free to reach out to one of the
                CS department's Diversity and Inclusion Student Advocates, or to
                Professor Greenwald or Professor Cetintemel (the CS department
                chair).  We, the CS department, take all complaints seriously.
