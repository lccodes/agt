<p>The first thing we did was create a pivot table averaging the Human Development Index (HDI) Rank and life expectancy for each region. We found that Africa had the lowest average HDI rank of 150.11 and average life expectancy of 61, while Europe had the highest average HDI rank of 33.63 and average life expectancy of 78.5. Next, we used LibreCalc’s filter tools to look only at data related to African countries, and then sorted in descending order to look at population growth and fertility rate. We discovered that while African countries had the highest fertility rates, their population growth is not that high, on average around 1.5%. We repeated the process with European countries, and discovered that European countries had low fertility rates, around 1 birth per woman. European countries, unsurprisingly, had a incredibly low population growth, for some regions averaging out to a negative number.</p>
<p>We graphed European and African countries’ fertility rates and population growth, as you can see below.</p>

<p>We then consolidated this data by creating another pivot table that sorted average fertility rate and population growth by European and African sub-regions. We then used this data to create a bar graph detailing the fertility rates in contrast to the population growth as you can see below.</p>

<p>We also made a scatter plot charting HDI rank versus fertility rate in African and European countries. Drawing from the plot, we can conclude that countries with higher HDI ranks have significantly lower fertility rates (births per woman) than countries with lower HDI ranks.</p>
