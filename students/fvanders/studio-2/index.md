# Trends in Fertility and Economic Development

Above are shown the HDI averages for each continent. Notice the large difference between Europe's average HDI and Africa's average HDI. We could imagine that as countries become more developed and richer, those people can afford to have more children. In Malthusian economics, this eventually leads to a exponential population growth. However, this is not what we observe in the data -- the people of more developed countries have fewer children.

African average fertility rates are much higher than European fertility rates. Higher infant mortality rates in Africa can account for some of the difference, however it is too high to be this factor alone. We can see from the data that Africa's annual population growth, at 2.3%, is greater than stagnant Europe, with only 0.5% growth.

I argue the following: as countries become more developed, they turn towards children of higher quality over quantity. With fewer children, parents invest more in education. As shown above, Africa and Europe contrast each other again with radically different averages for years of schooling. This may have resulted in a higher quality of living: Europeans live 17 years longer than Africans on average.

We can use internet use as an instrument for higher education and productivity. Using the internet requires literacy, but also sufficient education to navigate the web. The internet is highly advantageous because it allows for higher productivity: fewer resources have to be used to achieve complex tasks (for example, asking for directions or purchasing items). As shown above, we can see that there is an inverse trend between internet use and fertility.
