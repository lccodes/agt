We used a scatter plot to look at the relationship between a country's Gross National Income by capita and the amount of internet users per 100 people in the country. We found a positive correlation between these two variables - as GNI increases, there is exponential growth in internet users per 100 people.

We used a pivot table to compare mean life expectancy across regions. The highest life expectancy was in Europe (close to 80 years), while the lowest was in Africa (just above 60 years).
