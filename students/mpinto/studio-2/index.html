<h1 id="studio-2-findings">Studio 2 Findings</h1>
<p>During this studio, I sought to compare the GINI Coefficient to several other metrics and see the correlations between the Gini Coefficients and these metrics. I compared the Gini Coefficient to the Human Development Index, Percent Population Growth, Gross National Income per Capita and Percent of Population that is Rural. Based on the mean and median, I found that the Gini coefficient, Gross National Income per Capita and Percent of Population that is Rural were all right skewed and that the Human Development Index was left skewed.</p>
<p>A scatter plot between the Gini coefficeint and human development index showed no correlation, as did the scatter plot between the GINI Coefficient and the percentage of population that was rural.</p>

<p>Moreover, the scatter plot for the Gini Coefficient and Gross national Income per Capita showed that the GINI Coefficient of a country generally decreases as the gross national income per capita increases.</p>

</div>
<p>As a result, one can conclude that the gross national income per capita is a better metric for estimating the GINI Coefficient than the human development index and percentage of population that is rural.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the following graph shows the average GINI Coefficient of the countries in the Very high, high, middle and low human development groups.</p>
