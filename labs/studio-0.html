<h3 id="welcome">Welcome!</h3>

<h5 id="week-of-september-12th-2016">Week of September 12th 2016</h5>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>

<p>Welcome to your first CS100 studio! Today, we will be getting you ready for an exciting and productive semester. We will begin by signing course collaboration policies, and then we will set you all up with CS accounts (so that you can use the machines in the CS labs). Also on the agenda for today is getting you started with Markdown, a tool for creating web pages, and installing some software on your own personal laptops (if you happen to own one).</p>

<p>Upon completion of all of today’s tasks, a TA will give you credit for today’s studio. If you do not manage to complete all the assigned work during the studio period, do not worry. You can continue to work on this assignment until midnight on the Tuesday following this studio. Come by TA hours any time before then to show us your completed work and get credit for today’s studio.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>

<h5 id="by-the-end-of-this-studio-you-will">By the end of this studio, you will:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sign your collaboration policy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a CS account</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Join the course on Piazza</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn about pair programming</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn a little Markdown</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have fun finding some data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discuss learning vs. inference with your partner</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download LibreOffice and install RStudio (Optional)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Please see a TA to obtain a hard copy of the CS100 course collaboration policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read it, sign it, and return it to a TA. If you do not turn in a course collaboration policy, you will not get credit for today’s studio.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="create-a-cs-account">Create a CS Account</h3>
<p>The Sunlab consultants will be on hand during today’s studio to set everyone up with a Computer Science Department account.</p>

<h3 id="piazza">Piazza</h3>
<p>Please sign up for our course on <a href="http://piazza.com/brown/fall2016/csci0100">Piazza</a>.</p>

<p>Later on in this studio, you will be posting on one of our course’s Piazza discussions. Additionally, throughout the semester, you can post questions on Piazza, and a TA will respond.</p>

<h3 id="pair-programming">Pair programming</h3>
<p>During future studio sessions, we will be “pair programming,” meaning that two students will be working together to complete the tasks. To get a better understanding of what to expect, please read this <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0170/content/docs/pair-programming.pdf">pair programming guide</a>. Note that Amy originally compiled this guide for CS 17 / 18.</p>

<p>Once you have finished, please answer these True or False questions. You can jot your answers down on a piece of paper, or type them into a text file. Before you leave studio today, you will need to have them checked off by a TA.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>One student should be in charge of typing for the entire duration of a studio session.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pair programming is a divide-and-conquer strategy, in which each student works on a different part of the assignment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pair programming helps students learn more and write better code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to communicate respectfully while pair programming.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="markdown-tutorials">Markdown Tutorials</h3>
<p>Later on in the semester (after we finish working with spreadsheets), we will require that your assignments be handed in in Markdown, a simple language for easily producing web pages.</p>

<p>Complete lessons 1-13 of this <a href="http://www.markdown-tutorial.com/">tutorial</a>. (You need not complete lesson 14, since it teaches you how to insert code in Markdown, and you haven’t learned to write any code just yet.)</p>

<h3 id="fun-finding-data">Fun finding data!</h3>
<p>At some point soon, you will find yourself searching for your own data. So we’re going to practice now! At the end of <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs100/lectures/lecture2a.pdf">Lecture 2a</a> we demonstrated how to search for data specifying a topic and file type. Here’s a quick reminder:</p>

<p>You can use Google to search for CSV files by typing +filetype:csv in the search bar. For example, searching for South Africa +filetype:csv produces CSV files mentioning South Africa.</p>

<p>Find a CSV file on a topic you are interested in. Once you’ve found your data, please post it on Piazza. If you find something interesting, it might reappear later on in course material!</p>

<h3 id="learning-vs-inference">Learning vs. Inference</h3>
<p>In class, we discussed two cornerstones of data analysis: learning and inference. Discuss with a partner how these concepts differ, and how they are the same. Then search (your own minds, or Google) for 1-2 examples of problems which might be better categorized as learning and then for 1-2 examples that might be better characterized as inference.</p>

<p>Please post your examples on the appropriate discussion on our Piazza page. (Amy might want to change the examples she presents next year, since as interesting as she thought they were, this year’s examples did not seem to generate much conversation.)</p>

<h3 id="software-installations-on-your-personal-laptop-optional">Software Installations on your personal laptop (Optional!)</h3>
<p>All of the necessary software for the course can be accessed on CS computers in the CIT. (Aside from the room that you are currently in for studio, you may also use the computers in the Sunlab, which is on the CIT’s first floor.) However, you can also work on your homework assignments and the final project using a personal laptop. To install the software on your laptop, please follow the instructions below. Feel free to call over a TA if you need help.</p>

<p>In the first couple of studios, you will be using <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/install-howto/">LibreOffice</a>, free software that is similar to Microsoft Office:</p>

<p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org">These</a> are the instructions for downloading R.</p>

<p>You will also need to install <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/">RStudio Desktop</a>.</p>

<h3 id="end-of-studio">End of Studio</h3>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve completed your first CS 100 studio. It was not super exciting; we know. But hopefully you got some leg work out of the way, so that you are now in good shape to complete future, more interesting, assignments.</p>
