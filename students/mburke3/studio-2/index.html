<h1 id="hi">Hi!</h1>
<p>Marcus and Pearson have mapped average inequality in the world by region. We used a pivot table to calculate the average GINI coefficient by region. We concluded that the Americas have the highest level of inequality while Europe has the lowest. Below is a bar graph showing our results <img src="inequality.png" alt="Average Inequality by Region" /></p>
<p>Second we calculated a scatter plot to determine the relationship between the total population of a country and its corresponding rural population %. We concluded using a pivot table that there is no correlation between the two variables. <img src="percentagerural.png" alt="% Rural by Population" /></p>
