<p>First, I sorted the data in ascending and descending order of the human development index. I wanted to compare the countries with the top hdi’s with the countries with the lowest hdi’s. I filtered out the other results.In addition, the countries with the top eight hdi’s had unemployment rates in the median quartile.</p>

<p>The unemployment rate for the countries with the top eight human development index is low. The median unemployment rate for these countries is typically lower than the average unemployment rate.</p>
<p>By using a scatter plot, I determined that there is a relationship between life expectancy and expected years of schooling. In countries with the high life expectancy at birth, people tend to go to school longer.</p>
