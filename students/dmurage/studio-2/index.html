<p>I made a pivot table for the mean fertility rate versus mean years of schooling in the subregions provided in the dataset and made a bar chart. My idea was that with lower mean school years of schooling, we would find higher mean fertility rates. Interestingly, the data shows this is not necessarily the case - there is no definite correlation between the two variables. in New Zealand and Australia, for example, we had a 1:1 relationship while in East Africa, there was a 6:1 relationship for schooling versus fertility rate.</p>
